* Convert GlobalReplace to CLI and wrap it with GUI.
** GlobalReplace with 20+ images hits apihighlimit restriction.  Implement agresive save strategy.

== Low Priority ==
* Commons New Image Auditor
* RevDel?  Image RevDel?
* Log querying methods

* Internationalize namespaces.  I think I hard-code instances of namespace prefixes in English - these should be dynamically generated via namespace IDs
* Namespace handling just sucks in general.  I need to fix this...
* MBot organization will benefit from lambdas and aggregate ops
