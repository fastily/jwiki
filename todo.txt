* Convert GlobalReplace to CLI and wrap it with GUI.
** GlobalReplace with 20+ images hits apihighlimit restriction.  Perhaps we should add a delay...

* FLogin crypto is crap.  Keeps out non-CS people, but this is a joke to reverse engineer... 
** Salt should be secure random generated.
** Use MD5/MD6 hashes?
** Keys *should* be randomly generated - based on OS names, serial number, etc, user's account, time generated, perhaps?  We can save these locally.
*** There is a problem with this logic however, because the user isn't actually entering a password, and keys are going to be saved locally o_o.  I guess it's a step above plaintext...

* FLogin is still using old java.io.* ->  Update to nio.

* Drop Logger from code.

* Use only ArrayLists for lists of objects.  Type Safety and OO principles are important IMO.

== Low Priority ==
* Commons New Image Auditor
* Apparently addtext in edit already exists.
* RevDel?  Image RevDel?
* Log querying methods

* Internationalize namespaces.  I hardcode instances of namespace prefixes in English - these should be dynamically generated via namespace IDs

* Token handling has changed - use meta=tokens

* Theres a ton of tt markers.  Copyedit comments.
