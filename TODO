== Critical ==
* CommonsMover does not work on Windows.  Windows doesn't like certain symbols in file names, so I think I should do a String hash for temp file names.  This is going to require a fat audit of WikiFile, and will require integration of it with CommonsMover

== High Priority ==
* FQuery should support multiple title queries.  Create a new class... MassFQuery?  This requires partial rewrite of a f*ck ton of functions but will give us a massive performance boost in end-user applications.

* WikiGen is a horrible auth system.  I like the idea of saving the login tokens locally...but this makes for a horrible security problem.
* * Convert GlobalReplace to a command line app, then wrap it with a GUI (Blocked on revision of auth system)
* * Wrap CommonsMover into GUI. (Blocked on revision of auth system)

* Is there a way to eliminate password storage as a local vars?  Blocked on fixing central auth logins

== Low Priority ==
* Commons New Image Auditor
* Upgrade to Java 7
* JUnit Tests
