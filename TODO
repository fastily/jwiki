* FQuery should support multiple title queries.  Create a new class... MassFQuery?  This requires partial rewrite of a f*ck ton of functions but will give us a massive performance boost in end-user applications.
** I don't like the Reply class; it's *really* awkward.  This should be split into a tuple<ErrInfo, JSONObject reply>
* Convert GlobalReplace to a command line app, then wrap it with a GUI
** GR sometimes hits apihighlimit restriction.  Perhaps we should add a delay...
* Wrap CommonsMover into GUI
* Upgrade to Java 8
* Timestamp field (should be a date object, not a string) for revision is f*cked up.  Why is that?

* Commons New Image Auditor
* Legit JUnit Tests
