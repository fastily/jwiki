* FQuery should support multiple title queries.  Create a new class... MassFQuery?  This requires a complete rewrite of many internal functions but will give us a massive performance boost in end-user applications.

* I don't like the Reply class; it's *really* awkward.  This should be split into a tuple<ErrInfo, JSONObject reply>
** Actually, we could extend the JSONObject to do internal recursive searches...JSONParse is a de facto wrapper.

* Convert GlobalReplace to a command line app, then wrap it with a GUI
** GR sometimes hits apihighlimit restriction.  Perhaps we should add a delay...

* Timestamp field (should be a date object, not a string) for Revision is f*cked up sometimes.  Could be server side.

* FLogin crypto is crap.  Keeps out non-CS people, but this is a joke to reverse engineer... 
** Salt should be secure random generated.
** Use MD5/MD6 hashes?
** Should I be using base64 encoding to output files?  This isn't a built-in and I'm lazy...
** Keys *should* be randomly generated - based on OS names, serial number, etc, perhaps?  We can save these locally.

* Commons New Image Auditor
* Legit JUnit Tests
* Generators?
* Apparently addtext in edit already exists.
