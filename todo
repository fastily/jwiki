== Priority ==
* Create MassClientQuery class to perform multiple queries at once in a single query.  Obvious performance boost for the end user.

* Convert GlobalReplace to CLI and wrap it with GUI.
** GlobalReplace with 20+ images hits apihighlimit restriction.  Perhaps we should add a delay...

* Timestamp parsing for time field (should be a date/time object, not a string) in Revision/Contrib is really messed up sometimes.  Is this broken server side?

* FLogin crypto is crap.  Keeps out non-CS people, but this is a joke to reverse engineer... 
** Salt should be secure random generated.
** Use MD5/MD6 hashes?
** Should I be using base64 encoding to output files?  This isn't a built-in and I'm lazy... (may not be too important, seeing how machines which don't support UTF-8 probably aren't supported by java 8 anyhow...)
** Keys *should* be randomly generated - based on OS names, serial number, etc, perhaps?  We can save these locally.

* ClientTask should use nio.

== Low Priority ==
* Commons New Image Auditor
* Legit JUnit Tests
* Generators?
* Apparently addtext in edit already exists.
